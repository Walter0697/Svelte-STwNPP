### Simple Translator with No Practical Purpose

Built with svelte <br/>
using barbeque as main branch to avoid using main

### Purpose
- A simple translator with no practical purpose, it is just for fun, if you want to try it out, feel free to go to stwnpp.waltercheng.com
- Honestly, it is just svelte practice project

### About the site
- it converts English into few different things, I tried to make it translate the same thing as long as you type in the same thing even with the mocking spongebob one

### Libraries used
- Svelma
- sveltestrap

### Thoughts
- Svelte seems to have a lot of nice features and it simplifies a lot of things, I like it and will surely use it more. However, it is still a relatively new framework, I will wait and see how much it grows in the future.

### Disadvantage of Svelte
- hot reload really bugs me, I have no idea how to trigger it, even if I close the program and restart, things still don't reload
- I think libraries are still developing, sveltestrap will basically override your theme style so you should use it at your own risk, haven't tried the other css library yet so I am not sure which one is the best (like binding tabs value is useless so I basically did some hack for it)
